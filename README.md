# RimWorld4Debugging

### What is it?
I created this project to help everyone with debugging RimWorld. You simply download an electron application that will guide you through the process of installing all necessary tools and patches that are required. All tools are free of charge and the application will also help you to restore your RimWorld installation.

### Download Release
Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/pardeike/RimWorld4Debugging/releases/latest/download/rimworld4debugging-win32-x64-1.0.0.zip) and follow the instructions.

### Build Yourself
Clone this repository and then run
```
npm install
npm start
```
To build a release, run
```
npm run make
```
Which creates the application as a zip file in `./out/make/zip/win32/x64`
